this is Spin Game code  
it's based on angular2 v 4.2.4  
the project structure is mixed with angular cli and webpack.  
Noticed: for now only support webpack and http-server  
steps  

1. npm install to install all packages  
2. npm run webpackw use webpack to package  
3. http-server to run local http server  

./script-code/app is code base folder  
/pages/home-page is html that entered the canvas  
/module/game is all the game logic
